Ontrack Component review check

Component Name : - local-storage.coffee

Component Path :- ./src/app/config/local-storage/local-storage.coffee

Component purpose :- this component local-storage.coffee configures 'localstorage' usage in the application

Component outcomes/interactions - Basically, this component is used to configure the "localstorage" usage, which is used to set up the prefix on the key-value pair that gets stored in the web browser's local storage. for example: (user id, email), (login time), and (credentials token).

Component migration Check list – once migrated we need to check whether the code compiles without any errors or warnings.

Discussion with Client (Andrew Cain)
See if the component is still needed and present this document so Andrew can review if all the outcomes and interactions are correct prior to the migration and build of this component.
